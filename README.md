### Hello! 👋

I'm Gonzalo. You can mostly find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-aldana-ch%C3%A1vez-a1580a15b/). I love Flutter ❤️ and I'm working as Full Stack Developer on [Teeb Health](https://teeb.health/), as well as a freelance mobile dev.

I also sometimes write things on [my own website](https://gonzaloaldana.com).

- 📱 I’ve been the lead mobile dev in 2 startups, at this time my teams have published +5 apps, both built from scratch and refactored and updated legacy systems.
- 🌟 My top freelance project is "Taxi App", you can find the readme in my GitHub
- 💬 I help spread Flutter, I have given talks, workshops and mobile development classes.
- ❤️ Have I said I love Flutter?
- 🌱 I’m currently improving on Sequelize, Postgres, Docker... when I have time!
- Favorite editor: VS Code
